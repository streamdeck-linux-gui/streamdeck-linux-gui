# Automatic Semantic Release:
# This workflow analyzes commits since the last release and automatically:
# 1. Determines version bump based on conventional commits:
#    - fix: → patch (4.1.3 → 4.1.4)
#    - feat: → minor (4.1.3 → 4.2.0)
#    - BREAKING CHANGE: → major (4.1.3 → 5.0.0)
# 2. Updates version in pyproject.toml
# 3. Creates a GitHub release with changelog
# 4. Triggers the publish workflow to upload to PyPI
